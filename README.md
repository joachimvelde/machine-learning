# AI/ML in C
This is a private repository for exploring and implementing algorithms in AI/ML.

Note for your idiot brain: Even if the input of a layer is stored as a vector, the weights will still be stored in a matrix.
Example: 5 inputs => triple neuron layer: 3x5 weight matrix and 3x1 bias vector.
A = Ã¸(W x I + b)
